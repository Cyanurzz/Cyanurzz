# DUCELLIER JEAN    
## Web developer Junior   
 ### About me  
 Leaving the traditional education system, I turned to food/seasonal work, the opportunity to take my independence to better rebound.

Thanks to one of my best encounters, I had the opportunity to work in a magical place: a neighbourhood cinema! I discovered a really exciting world there: being able to talk with customers, managing a cinema, from the screening to the reception with a very awesome team!

There was only one thing I was missing, the most important thing for me: creation!

Afterwards, I started looking for a project that would suit me and make me want to move forward every day in order to fully develop myself.

I discovered the wonderful world of MOOC to deepen the web development! At first I decided to become a web developer.

It's with this goal in mind that I undertook a 10 months training at Wild Code School in Orleans in Java/SpringMVC to achieve this new goal!

It made me realize what I wanted ... Become a Developer !

Developeur web is only one step. Since the end of this training, I've been working on my spare time on other skills oriented on the development of video games (UNITY, C#, .net and Blender) in order to realize my childhood dream:
Creating and working in the world of video games!
